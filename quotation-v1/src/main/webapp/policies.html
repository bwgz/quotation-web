			<h3>Terms of Service</h3>
			<p>Last modified: September 7, 2013</p>
			<h4>Welcome to Quotation</h4>
			<p>Thanks for using our products and services (“Services”). The Services are provided by bwgz.org.</p>
			<p>By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read them carefully.</p>
			<h5>Using our Services</h5>
			<p>Don’t misuse our Services. For example, don’t interfere with our Services or try to access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.</p>
			<p>Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. You may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.</p>
			<p>Our Services display some content that is not ours. This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please don’t assume that we do.</p>
			<h5 id="toc-software">About Software in our Services</h5>
			<p>bwgz.org gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by bwgz.org as part of the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by bwgz.org, in the manner permitted by these terms. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services or included software, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our written permission.</p>
			<p>Open source software is important to us. Some software used in our Services may be offered under an open source license that we will make available to you. There may be provisions in the open source license that expressly override some of these terms.</p>
			<h5 id="toc-modification">Modifying and Terminating our Services</h5>
			<p>We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether.</p>
			<p>You can stop using our Services at any time, although we’ll be sorry to see you go. bwgz.org may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.</p>
			<h5 id="toc-warranties-disclaimers">Our Warranties and Disclaimers</h5>
			<p>We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there are certain things that we don’t promise about our Services.</p>
			<p>OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS, NEITHER BWGZ.ORG NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON’T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT WITHIN THE SERVICES, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTION OF THE SERVICES, OR THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES “AS IS”.</p>
			<p>SOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES.</p>
			<h5 id="toc-liability">Liability for our Services</h5>
			<p>WHEN PERMITTED BY LAW, BWGZ.ORG, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA, FINANCIAL LOSSES OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.</p>
			<p>TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF BWGZ.ORG, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIM UNDER THESE TERMS, INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE SERVICES (OR, IF WE CHOOSE, TO SUPPLYING YOU THE SERVICES AGAIN).</p>
			<p>IN ALL CASES, BWGZ.ORG, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.</p>
			<h5 id="toc-business-uses">Business uses of our Services</h5>
			<p>If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify bwgz.org and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any claim, suit or action arising from or related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys’ fees.</p>
			<h5 id="toc-about">About these Terms</h5>
			<p>We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. Changes will apply immediately after they are posted. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.</p>
			<p>If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for that conflict.</p>
			<p>These terms control the relationship between bwgz.org and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.</p>
			<p>If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away, this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).</p>
			<p>If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.</p>
			<p>The laws of Minnesota, U.S.A. will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services. All claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Hennepin County, Minnesota, USA, and you and bwgz.org consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.

			<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
			<p>Last modified: December 3, 2013</p>
			<p>Your privacy is very important to us. Accordingly, we have developed this Policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate and disclose and make use of personal information. The following outlines our privacy policy.</p>
			<h5>Information we collect</h5>
			<p>We collect information to provide better services to all of our users – from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful.</p>
			<p>We collect information in the following ways:</p>
			<ul class="disc">
				<li>
					We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number).
				</li>
				<li>
					When you use our services or view content provided by bwgz.org, we may automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This may include:
					<ul class="disc">
						<li>Details of how you used our service.</li>
						<li>Internet protocol address.</li>
						<li>Device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					We use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit a bwgz.org service, and this may include sending one or more cookies or anonymous identifiers to your device. We also use cookies and anonymous identifiers when you interact with services we offer to our partners, such as advertising services or features that may appear on other sites.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h6>Google Analytics (Google)</h6>
			<p>Google Analytics is a web analysis service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”). Google utilizes the data collected to track and examine the use of this application, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services. Google may use the data collected to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. For the opt-out: <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a><p>
			<h6>Google Adsense (Google)</h6>
			<p>Google Adsense is a web advertising service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”). 
			<ul class="disc">
			  <li>Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to your website.</li>
			  <li>Google's use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet.</li>
			  <li>Users may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick cookie for interest-based advertising by visiting <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/">Ads Settings</a>. You may also  opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies for interest based advertising by visiting <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">aboutads.info</a>.)</li>
			</ul>			
			<h5>How we use information we collect</h5>
			<p>We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect bwgz.org and our users. We may also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more relevant results and ads.</p>
			<p>When you contact bwgz.org, we may keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.</p>
			<p>We use information collected from cookies and other technologies to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services. For example, by saving your language preferences, we’ll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we will not associate a cookie or anonymous identifier with sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health.</p>
			<p>We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other third party services – for example to make it easier to share things with people you know.</p>
			<p>We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
			<h5>Application</h5>
			<p>Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, including products or sites that may be displayed to you, or other sites linked from our services. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other companies and organizations who advertise our services, and who may use cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to serve and offer relevant ads.</p>
			<h5>Changes</h5>
			<p>Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice.</p>
