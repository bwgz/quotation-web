				<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
				<p>Last modified: December 3, 2013</p>
				<p>Your privacy is very important to us. Accordingly, we have developed this Policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate and disclose and make use of personal information. The following outlines our privacy policy.</p>
				<h4>Information we collect</h4>
				<p>We collect information to provide better services to all of our users - from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you'll find most useful.</p>
				<p>We collect information in the following ways:</p>
				<ul class="disc">
					<li>
						We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number).
					</li>
					<li>
						When you use our services or view content provided by bwgz.org, we may automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This may include:
						<ul class="disc">
							<li>Details of how you used our service.</li>
							<li>Internet protocol address.</li>
							<li>Device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						We use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit a bwgz.org service, and this may include sending one or more cookies or anonymous identifiers to your device. We also use cookies and anonymous identifiers when you interact with services we offer to our partners, such as advertising services or features that may appear on other sites.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Google Analytics (Google)</h5>
				<p>Google Analytics is a web analysis service provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google utilizes the data collected to track and examine the use of this application, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services. Google may use the data collected to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. For the opt-out: <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a><p>
				<h5>Google Adsense (Google)</h5>
				<p>Google Adsense is a web advertising service provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). 
				<ul class="disc">
				  <li>Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to your website.</li>
				  <li>Google's use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet.</li>
				  <li>Users may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick cookie for interest-based advertising by visiting <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/">Ads Settings</a>. You may also  opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies for interest based advertising by visiting <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">aboutads.info</a>.)</li>
				</ul>			
				<h4>How we use information we collect</h4>
				<p>We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect bwgz.org and our users. We may also use this information to offer you tailored content - like giving you more relevant results and ads.</p>
				<p>When you contact bwgz.org, we may keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.</p>
				<p>We use information collected from cookies and other technologies to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services. For example, by saving your language preferences, we'll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we will not associate a cookie or anonymous identifier with sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health.</p>
				<p>We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other third party services - for example to make it easier to share things with people you know.</p>
				<p>We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
				<h4>Application</h4>
				<p>Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, including products or sites that may be displayed to you, or other sites linked from our services. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other companies and organizations who advertise our services, and who may use cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to serve and offer relevant ads.</p>
				<h4>Changes</h4>
				<p>Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice.</p>
